# Search-Based Software Engineering for Self-Adaptive Systems
Raw data for the paper entitled "Search-Based Software Engineering for Self-Adaptive Systems: Survey, Disappointments, Suggestions and Opportunities‚Äù. A description of the content of this repository can be found below:

## The ***survey*** directory
This contains the extracted data items of all the primary studies and the actual papers. Note that each paper is named by "year of publication"-"the citation count by the time when data collection concluded".

## The ***experiments*** directory
This contains the data of experiments used to justify the likely issues caused by each of the disappointments identified. All the data is grouped according to the corresponding research question. Note that, to reduce the file size, the basic notations required for text editor software to parse the data file have been removed, thereby the ".rtf" files can only be read by command tools such as ***cat*** or ***vim***.

All the experiments are run under the SBSE for SAS framework ([SSASE](https://github.com/taochen/ssase)), which is partially underpined by [jMetal search algorithms library](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal). The real-world subject SASs and their code/data used in the work can be found below:
